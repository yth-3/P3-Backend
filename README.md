# P3-Backend: Composite Care

## Purpose

Visiting your doctor should not be a complicated affair. It becomes complicated when the patient not only needs to manage their health problems, but also needs to manage interactions with the health insurance and communications between doctors and nurses. Furthermore, they often need to act as the go-between for the health providers and the insurance providers without any tools for managing this interaction. 

We propose a web portal that brings the three parties together, making the interactions between the parties explicit, and providing the means to manage the interactions. 

Our MVP start by focusing on dealing with the interaction between the patient and their insurer, and then we plan to expand from there.
